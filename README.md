# JarvisAuth â€“ User, Application, and Permission Manager in ASP.NET 8

JarvisAuth is an API designed to simplify the management of users, applications, and permissions. I developed this project to study software architecture patterns and other development practices in .NET. In the future, I plan to add new features as I progress in my learning roadmap and explore new technologies and best practices.

---

###### The architecture of this project was designed to be both functional and scalable, making it a potential reference even for real-world applications. If you find the project interesting, please leave a star :star:

## Technologies / Components Implemented

- ASP.NET 8 WebApi
- HealthCheck
- Clean Architecture
- SQLite
- Unit Testing (with xUnit)
- JWT Token
- Refresh Token
- Docker (with Dockerfile and Compose)
- ElasticSearch
- Kibana

## Architecture Overview

The project is architected in 5 layers:

- **Presentation**: Interface layer responsible for exposing the Web API and receiving user requests.
- **Application**: Application layer tasked with orchestrating use cases and managing logic between the domain and infrastructure layers.
- **Core**: Shared layer containing reusable classes that do not depend on other layers.
- **Domain**: Business layer where the fundamental rules and entities of the application reside.
- **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure layer responsible for interacting with external resources, such as databases and other services.

All following the principles of Clean Architecture and SOLID to ensure better organization, scalability, and best coding practices.

## Database Diagram Overview

I used SQLite as the database to simplify application execution, making it easier for anyone who wants to explore the project in more depth.

## Overview of the Kibana Dashboard with ElasticSearch

The Kibana dashboard provides a visual representation of the logs and metrics collected by Elasticsearch. It is configured to help monitor the application's behavior, track requests, and debug issues effectively.

# Getting Started

The JarvisAuth project can be run on any operating system, **as long as Docker is installed on your environment.** ([Get Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

Clone the JarvisAuth repository, navigate to the root folder where the **docker-compose.yml** file is located, and follow the instructions below:

### If you only want to run the JarvisAuth application in your Docker environment:

```
docker-compose up
```
After completing the container creation in Docker, the application will be available at the following addresses:

- **JarvisAuth API:** ```http://localhost:8081/swagger/index.html```
- **Kibana Dashboard:** ```http://localhost:5601/```

### If you want to run the JarvisAuth application in Visual Studio:

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Visual Studio 2022 (Recommended)
- .NET SDK 8

1. Open the **JarvisAuth.sln** file in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click on the JarvisAuth.API project and select "Set as Startup Project."
3. Press **F5** or click **Run** to start the application.
